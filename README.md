This application is intended to make it easy for non-technical users to create
and maintain Scottish country dance Ball programs using my
[tartan](https://github.com/kingjon3377/tartan) LaTeX package. By its 1.0
release, it will allow you to select dances from a downloaded copy of [the
Scottish Country Dance Database](https://my.strathspey.org/dd/index/), revise
their directions, arrange them in any order you like, and write out the Ball
program to a LaTeX document that you can then typeset (using, for example, the
copy of [TeXworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeXworks) bundled with
[MiKTeX](https://miktex.org)) into a PDF, or which you will be able to reopen
again in this application to continue editing later.
